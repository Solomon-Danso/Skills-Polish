# Data Types
To analyze data, it is important to know what type of data we are dealing with.
We can split the data types into three main categories:
<br/> [-] Numerical <br/>
[-] Categorical <br/>
[-] Ordinal <br/>



**`Numerical`**:
```typescript
Numbers
Discrete Data => Fixed Numbers [Integers]
Continuous Data => Any Number [Decimal]
```

**`Categorical`**:
```typescript
a color value,
or any yes/no values
```

**`Ordinal`**:
```typescript
school grades where A is better than B and so on.
```
